Consider the frustration of working with a colleague who forgets everything you tell them, requiring constant repetition! As AI agents undertake more complex tasks involving numerous user interactions, equipping them with memory becomes equally crucial for efficiency and user satisfaction. With memory, agents can learn from feedback and adapt to users\\' preferences. [...] | Procedural | Instructions | Instincts or motor skills | Agent system prompt |\\nSemantic Memory¶\\nSemantic memory, both in humans and AI agents, involves the retention of specific facts and concepts. In humans, it can include information learned in school and the understanding of concepts and their relationships. For AI agents, semantic memory is often used to personalize applications by remembering facts or concepts from past interactions. [...] When do you want to update memories?\\nMemory can be updated as part of an agent\\'s application logic (e.g. \"on the hot path\"). In this case, the agent typically decides to remember facts before responding to a user. Alternatively, memory can be updated as a background task (logic that runs in the background / asynchronously and generates memories). We explain the tradeoffs between these approaches in the section below.\\nMemory types¶\\nPractical: Memory underlies many of our cognitive functions. Far from being just a storage system for past events, memory actively helps us think about the future and make decisions. Drawing on past experiences lets us simulate possible future scenarios and apply lessons learned when facing choices. In fact, memory is involved in everything from problem-solving and communication to social skills like empathy - suggesting it\\'s woven into nearly every aspect of complex thought. Without memory, [...] Memory also enables meaningful personalization. When an AI agent remembers your preferences, history, or goals, it can tailor its responses specifically to you. A personal assistant that remembers your favorite restaurants or previous travel plans can make more relevant suggestions. A recommendation system that recalls your past ratings can better predict what you\\'ll like. In technical terms, long-term memory lets agents store historical data and user profiles, which directly improves their [...] Memory in AI doesn\\'t just produce better task performance – it shapes how users emotionally relate to and trust the system. An AI agent capable of remembering and learning over time tends to feel more human and empathetic.\\nMemory in agents is one of the main tools to allow planning that is grounded in the relevant context and there are many aspects to memory that you should take\\nMemory in this context is a set of tool commands for updating a list that gets inserted into the system prompt across chat sessions. https://\\nIn summary, short-term memory is associated with working memory, while long-term memory encompasses episodic memory (experiences), semantic memory (knowledge), and procedural memory (skills and procedures) in AI agents. These memory components work together to enable the agent\\'s cognitive capabilities and performance across various tasks. [...] Reduction in redundancy: Memory systems help avoid redundant processing by recalling previously encountered information, thus improving response time and resource utilisation.\\nAdaptive interactions: AI can adapt to users\\' changing needs and preferences over time, offering more relevant and accurate responses. [...] Contextual awareness: Short-term memory bridges the gap between interactions, allowing agents to recall recent user inputs and tailor responses accordingly. This is akin to human working memory, where immediate past interactions inform the current response.\\nFacilitate long-term learning: Long-term memory stores past experiences, enabling agents to build knowledge and improve decision-making over time.')], 'question': \"What is the function of memory in an agent's system?\"}}\n",
